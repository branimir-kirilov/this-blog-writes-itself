# Quantum Computing: Breaking Down the Basics

Quantum computing represents one of the most exciting frontiers in computer science today. Unlike classical computers that use bits (0s and 1s), quantum computers leverage quantum bits or 'qubits' that can exist in multiple states simultaneously thanks to the principles of quantum mechanics.

## The Quantum Advantage

This fundamental difference gives quantum computers the potential to solve certain problems exponentially faster than even the most powerful classical supercomputers. Problems like factoring large numbers, which forms the basis of our current encryption technology, or simulating complex molecular interactions for drug discovery, become tractable with sufficient quantum computing power.

## How It Works

The core quantum mechanical properties that enable this computational advantage are superposition and entanglement. Superposition allows qubits to exist in multiple states at once, while entanglement creates correlations between qubits that can be leveraged for computation.

## Engineering Challenges

```js
void setup() {
  Serial.begin(115200);
  Serial.setTimeout(2000);
  while (!Serial) { }

  initializeOledAndShowStartupScreen();

  setupWifi();

  configureFirebase();
}

void loop() {
  if (Firebase.ready()) { // According to the docs, this needs to be called repeatedly to handle autentication
    sendDataToRTDB();
    delay(10000);
  }
}

unsigned long getEpochTime() {
  timeClient.update();
  unsigned long now = timeClient.getEpochTime(); 
  return now;
}

int getSensorReading() {
  int sensorReading = analogRead(SensorPin);
  Serial.printf("Sensor: %d \n", sensorReading);
  return sensorReading;
}

int getMoisturePercent(int sensorReading) {
  int soilMoisturePercent = map(sensorReading, WaterValue, AirValue, 100, 0);
  if (soilMoisturePercent > 100) {
    soilMoisturePercent = 100;
  } else if (soilMoisturePercent < 0) {
    soilMoisturePercent = 0;
  }
  Serial.printf("Moist.: %d%% \n", soilMoisturePercent);
  return soilMoisturePercent;
}
```

However, building practical quantum computers faces enormous engineering challenges. Qubits are extremely fragile and susceptible to environmental interference, requiring sophisticated error correction techniques and often extreme cooling to near absolute zero temperatures.

## Progress and Potential

Despite these challenges, companies like IBM, Google, and a host of startups are making remarkable progress. In 2019, Google claimed to achieve 'quantum supremacy' by performing a calculation that would be practically impossible on classical hardware.

As quantum computing continues to mature, we can expect transformative applications across fields ranging from cryptography and materials science to optimization problems in logistics and finance. While a quantum computer isn't likely to replace your laptop anytime soon, its impact on specific computational domains will be profound.
